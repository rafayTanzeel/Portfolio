            <p>
                Built a distributed file system with transactional semantics using Python. 
                A transaction is a sequence of file operations that follow the properties of (A)tomicity, 
                (C)consistency, (I)solation and (D)urability (ACID). That is, each sequence of file operations 
                appears atomic, leave the file system consistent, work in face of concurrency and survive server or 
                client failures.
