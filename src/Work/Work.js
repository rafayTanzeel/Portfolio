                <p>
                    Visier is a phenomenal company with a very googlish like structure.
                    Initiation of new employees was followed by a series of orientations and small training
                    program to get the new employees up and running quickly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This training program included a bunch of presentations delivered by senior developers 
                    to give a sense of companyâ€™s business model and overall software architecture. Employees also 
                    underwent a Scala and JavaScript certifications, core technologies used by the company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was part of a team of 11 developers, and we collaborated with each other to help improve Visier's product. 
                    I worked closely with senior software developer to perform regression and automation performance 
                    analysis, heap dump analysis of garbage collection to find memory leaks, extensive memory profiling and writing scripts in Scala 
                    to improve the regression testing workflow of the Visier Cloud Application.
